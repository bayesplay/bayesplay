The goal of bayesplay is to provide an interface for calculating Bayes factors for simple models. It does this in a way that makes the calculations more *transparent* and it is therefore useful as a teaching tools. 

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ljcolling/bayesplay")
```

## Basic usage 

The `bayesplay` package comes with three basic functions for computing Bayes factors.

1. The `likelihood()` function for specifying likelihoods

2. The `prior()` function for specifying priors

3. And the `integral()` function

Currently the following distributions are supported for likelihoods and priors

### Priors 

1. Normal distribution (`normal`)

2. Uniform distribution (`uniform`)

3. Scaled and shifted *t* distribution (`student_t`)

4. Cauchy distributions (`cauchy`)

### Likelihood

1. Normal distribution (`normal`)

3. *t* distribution, including scaled and shifted *t* distribution (`student_t`) 
and *d* scaled (`noncentral_d`) and *t* scaled (`noncentral_t`) noncentral *t* 
distributions
