The goal of bayesplay is to provide an interface for calculating Bayes factors for simple models. It does this in a way that makes the calculations more *transparent* and it is therefore useful as a teaching tools. 

## Installation

bayesplay is now on CRAN. You can install it with:

```r
install.packages("bayesplay")
```

Or if you want to live on the edge, you can install the development version 
from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bayesplay/bayesplay")
```

## Basic usage 

The `bayesplay` package comes with three basic functions for computing Bayes factors.

1. The `likelihood()` function for specifying likelihoods

2. The `prior()` function for specifying priors

3. And the `integral()` function

Currently the following distributions are supported for likelihoods and priors

### Priors 

1. Normal distribution (`normal`)

2. Uniform distribution (`uniform`)

3. Scaled and shifted *t* distribution (`student_t`)

4. Cauchy distributions (`cauchy`)

5. Beta distribution (`beta`)

### Likelihood

1. Normal distribution (`normal`)

2. Scaled and shifted *t* distribution (`student_t`)

3. Binomial distribution (`binomial`)

4. Various noncentral *t* distributions, including: 

    - Noncentral *t* distribution (`noncentral_t`)
    
    - Noncentral *t* distribution scaled for a paired samples/one sample Cohen's *d* (`noncentral_d`)
    
    - Noncentral *t* distribution scaled for an independent samples Cohen's *d* (`noncentral_d2`)
    
## Worked examples

For worked examples of the basic usage see [basic usage](https://bayesplay.github.io/bayesplay/articles/basic.html). Or for basic plot functionality see [basic plotting](https://bayesplay.github.io/bayesplay/articles/plots.html)

## Changelog

> Breaking changes for < v0.9.0
>
> `distribution` parameter for specifying likelihoods and priors has been renamed `family`
>
> `noncentral_d` and `noncentral_d2` are now parametrised in terms of sample size rather than df
