Title: The Bayes Factor Playground 
Version: 0.9.4
Description: A lightweight modelling syntax for defining likelihoods and priors
    and for computing Bayes factors for simple one parameter models. It includes
    functionality for computing and plotting priors, likelihoods, and model
    predictions. Additional functionality is included for computing and plotting
    posteriors.
